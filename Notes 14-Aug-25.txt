Grouping  Scripts
Grouping scripts refers to organizing and managing JavaScript code into modular, maintainable chunks rather than one large file. 
This can involve:
Splitting code across multiple files (modules)
Importing/exporting (using ES6 modules)
Bundling files (with tools like Webpack, Rollup, Vite)
Module Import & Export concept 

Non-Blocking Scripts
By default, adding <script> tags in HTML can 
block the page from rendering until the script loads and executes.

Solutions to Avoid Blocking

a. defer (Recommended for most scripts)
<script src="main.js" defer></script>
Loads the script in parallel while the HTML continues parsing.
Executes after the document is parsed, in order of appearance.

b. async
<script src="analytics.js" async></script>
Loads and executes the script as soon as it's downloaded, possibly before the HTML is 
fully parsed.Execution order is not guaranteed.
